# Project Convert Numbers to English

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and Npm installed on your environment.
And please use the appropriate [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin for your Editor (not mandatory).

## Functionalities

- the app converts the number into words, even the decimal numbers
- the app on the backend side returns an error if you submit an invalid value and show a Snackbar with the error
- the app has a lot of mocha tests to test the logic and you can run them from the root of the project with the instruction
    $ npm run test
- the app take trace of the latest 10 conversions and save this history inside the localstorage
- I used Material-UI for the theme of the app and 'react-app-polyfill/ie11' to have a running application even in IE11
- you can find the generated documentation of the client side in /client/src/docs/components.json generated by the package react-docgen
- tested the Apis using mocha/chai and running the command
    $ npm run test
